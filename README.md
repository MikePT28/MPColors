#UIColor+MPColors
Implementation of methods to extend the funtinality and use of the UIColor class.

The list of methods will continue to evolve as I keep finding new needs for color creation or people suggest new methods.

# Installation

Just copy the "UIColor+MPColors.h" and "UIColor+MPColors.m" to your project folder.

# Usage

Add the "UIColor+MPColors.h" header to the classes you desire.

The documentation for every method is very well explained in the files.

# License
