#UIColor+MPColors
Implementation of methods to extend the funtinality and use of the UIColor class.

The list of methods will continue to evolve as I keep finding new needs for color creation or people suggest new methods.

###Features

- Create color from a HexRGB Value (Ex: `0xFFFFFF`) & HexRGBA Value .

- Create color from a HexRGB String with either # or 0x or neither. (Ex: `@"FFFFFF"` or `@"#FFFFFF"` or `@"0xFFFFFF"`) & HexRGBA String (Ex: `@"FFFFFFFF"` or `@"#FFFFFFFF"` or `@"0xFFFFFFFF"`).

- Create color from with Base255 int values and also Base100 alpha value.

- Create color from Base255 RGB String (Ex: `@"255,255,255"`) and also with alpha (Ex: `@"255,255,255,1.0"`).

### Installation

Just copy the "UIColor+MPColors.h" and "UIColor+MPColors.m" to your project folder.

### Usage

The documentation for every method is very well explained in the files.
